/* Condition Variables:

A condition variable is a variable of type pthread_cond_t and is used with the appropriate functions for waiting and later, process continuation. The condition variable mechanism allows threads to suspend execution and relinquish the processor until some condition is true. A condition variable must always be associated with a mutex to avoid a race condition created by one thread preparing to wait and another thread which may signal the condition before the first thread actually waits on it resulting in a deadlock. The thread will be perpetually waiting for a signal that is never sent. Any mutex can be used, there is no explicit link between the mutex and the condition variable.

Functions used in conjunction with the condition variable:

    Creating/Destroying:
        pthread_cond_init
        pthread_cond_t cond = PTHREAD_COND_INITIALIZER;
        pthread_cond_destroy
    Waiting on condition:
        pthread_cond_wait
        pthread_cond_timedwait - place limit on how long it will block.
    Waking thread based on condition:
        pthread_cond_signal
        pthread_cond_broadcast - wake up all threads blocked by the specified condition variable.
